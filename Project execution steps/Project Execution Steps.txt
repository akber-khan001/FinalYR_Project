Project Execution Steps:
1. Gather all the reqired components: Arduino UNO, ESP 8266 Wi-Fi Module, Relay Driver Module, LDR sensor, Light Bulb Holder, 1k resitor, Copper wires, Bread board, wooden chasi.
2. Download Arduino IDE in the system to implement the code.
3. Test the working of all the components by integrating them with Arduino UNO.
4. Connect the Arduino UNO to the system using a USB to UART cable and then test the components.
5. Write the code for the implementation of the project and upload the code to Arduino UNO.
6. Open Thing Speak API in the web browser.
7. Go to the channel that has been created for the project. 
8. Enable both public and private views if required.
9. Now during night time(i.e. when the incoming light intensity is less than the threshold set) the light bulb will automatically turn on.
10. Later when the sun rises and the incident light intensity is greater than the threshold set, the light bulb automatically turns off.
11. This data from the LDR sensors is continiously sent to the cloud server (Thing Speak API) using the ESP 8266 Wi-Fi module and visualizations are created.
12. These visualizations allow us to monitor the working of the smart street lighting system remotly.
13. From these visualizations we can identofy if the various components and working properly or not.
14. Hence using our project we can automate the street lights and monitor them remotely.
15. Also due to automation the man made errors are avoided and electricity is saved in the long run.
